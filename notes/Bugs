That item has already been oset by someone else.

You bestow power into <============|XXXXD -=Plague=- through the Dark Ritual.
You should change it to just adding the hit and dam
to the item instead of osetting
thats what i did on the last mcloud i worked at
works better :D

So anyways, a while ago I forged ivory hilts on to my weapons and got
Cure Serious on them.  I dealt with it but just realized I am now
cursing myself... :)
 
Curse.
You are affected by:
Spell: 'cure serious' modifies save vs spell by 1 for 227 hours with bits curse.
Spell: 'cure serious' modifies hit roll by -1 for 227 hours with bits curse.
 
 
Just a small bug, probably a skill_table[] error...

I think you might want to check the exp given again. I've
been exping for at least 30 minutes and haven't made enough for a single
convert yet, even with double exp on.

ok, now I'm suddenly getting good exp. In rooms where
I was getting about 300k-350k average exp a room, I'm
now suddenly getting about 750k. Not sure what changed
or why I'm getting exp like that now.
Maybe it was giving the minimum amount of exp for awhile
or no double exp or something?

hmmm, now I'm getting about 250k-270k exp a room. Seems like
it fluctuates a bunch and can't make up its mind where its
going to settle at. Not really sure if its supposed
to be like this or not, so figured I'd post one last
time about it.

seems to have something wrong with it. Seth tried using
it on wolf and demon, and couldn't get it to work so I
made a test demon to check and it wouldn't work
for me either. you can research, but it never goes up any
so you are unable to train it.
