I think soul weaps are messed up. I'm using them to weapon train
and I keep getting this message.. You are unable to enchant this weapon.
it shows up a ton when using superberserk and it wasn't
showing up before I used soul weaps, so I figure
they are the reason.

I can superberserk just fine when I wear weaps, but
when I go unarmed, the mud crashes. can someone take
a look and see if its my char thats the problem, or 
if its something with superberserk?
